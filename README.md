# Medical-Insurance-Claims-Analysis-Real-Time-Dynamic-Model
This project focuses on analyzing medical insurance claims data for employees. The goal was to compare the current year's insurance costs with the previous year's data up to today. The project aims to identify the percentage change in costs and detect any potential manipulation or misuse of the insurance by identifying the top 10 individuals with the highest claims.

# Objectives:

Compare the current year's insurance claims costs with the previous year's claims data.
Calculate the percentage change in insurance costs between the two years.
Identify the top 10 individuals with the highest claims to spot potential fraud or misuse.
Provide real-time analysis by comparing the current data with the same period last year.

# Tools & Technologies Used:

* **Power BI**: For data visualization, creating dashboards, and interactive reports.
* **DAX**: To create dynamic calculations and measures for cost comparisons, percentages, and identifying trends.
* **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preprocessing before importing to Power BI.
# Key Insights:

The dynamic model helps analyze current claims data and compare it to previous years, providing insights into cost trends and potential discrepancies.
Real-time data analysis allows for continuous monitoring, identifying patterns and anomalies in claims.
The top 10 claimants are highlighted to detect any unusual or fraudulent behavior that could be impacting the overall costs.

 **This model supports strategic decision-making, cost management, and optimization of the medical insurance program.**
